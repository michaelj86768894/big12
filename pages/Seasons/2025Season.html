<body>
	
	

<p>The 2025 season marks the 13th year of the Big 12 Fantasy League, and it kicked off in style on Thursday, September 4th. Last year’s champions, the Tucson Sugar Skulls, clashed with their division rivals, the Los Angeles Wildcats, in one of the most thrilling opening night games the league has seen. Both teams shattered their projected scores as the win probability swung back and forth until the final horn, with Los Angeles pulling out a 213.1 to 192.25 victory.</p>
	
<p>The season will run through Sunday, December 28th, culminating in the Big 12 Championship in Santa Clara, California.</p>

<p>No front office drama to report this year—every GM is back at the helm, ready to run it back for another wild ride. The only shake-up came from the reigning champs, the Green Bay Blizzard, who stunned the league with a full rebrand to the Tucson Sugar Skulls.</p>
	
	<p>Some say it’s a bold move to shed a championship identity, others think it’s just an intimidation tactic—because nothing says “we’re coming for you again” like trading snowflakes for skulls. Either way, the Sugar Skulls enter 2025 with a target on their backs and plenty of swagger.</p>
	
	<p>League insiders were quick to react:
		<ul>
  <li>“Changing the name after winning it all? That’s like Jordan dropping the Bulls logo for a skull tattoo. Respect.” – Anonymous GM</li>
  <li>“They may be called the Sugar Skulls, but there’s nothing sweet about playing them.” – X User @Blizzardfan4lyfe</li>
  <li>“Classic move—win a title, then try to sell more merch.” – League cynic</li>

<p>The 2025 Big 12 Draft kicked off on Monday, September 1st at 7:30 PM—marking the final draft of the re-draft era before the league transitions to dynasty in 2026. Draft nominations were determined randomly one hour before kickoff, giving Los Angeles the #1 pick and Vegas the final nomination of the evening.</p>
	
	
<p>The auction draft delivered everything fans love: bold moves, surprise reaches, and a handful of outright steals. Highlights included:
<ul>
	<li>First player signed: Ja’Mar Chase, $79, by Vegas</li>
	<li>Highest paid player: Jammer Gibbs, $83, by Tucson</li>
	<li>Last player signed: Paulson Adebo, by Vegas</li>
	</ul>
	
	</p>
	
	
	<p>League insiders had plenty to say:
<ul>
	<li>“Vegas went all in on Chase immediately. Classic power move.” – Anonymous GM</li>
	<li>“Tucson paying $83 for Gibbs? Bold. I like it… or I hate it. Still processing.” – Rival coach</li>
	<li>"Chicago overbidding on Lamar only to sign Dak for cheaper right after is mind boggling, fire GM Clay now!" – League cynic</li>
	</ul>

		<button class="collapsible"> Regular Season<hr></button>
<div class="content">
<p>The 2025 season spanned 14 weeks and 168 games, kicking off on the Thursday night following Labor Day—a staple tradition for the league’s opening night. Each team squared off twice against division rivals and once against all other teams, with the final week subject to flex scheduling to keep playoff races and divisional championships competitive.</p>
	
<p>For those still nostalgic about the experimental days, the league maintained three individual defensive positions (IDP) in lieu of team defenses—a nod to the innovation introduced back in 2022, though many GMs might barely remember the switch at this point.</p>
	
<p>Continuing a long-standing trend, the league embraced flex scheduling for the final week of the regular season, a strategy that added drama to playoff seeding and divisional matchups. “Nothing spices up Week 14 like moving games around and watching the standings shuffle,” quipped one anonymous GM. Another added, “Flex scheduling is basically fantasy football’s version of musical chairs—and I live for it.”</p>

	<li>#4 seed vs. #5 seed</li>
	</ul>
		</p>

<p>Stay tuned! The 2025 postseason promises high-stakes matchups, buzzer-beater finishes, and plenty of league drama. Check back during the playoffs for full recaps, highlights, and all the inside commentary as the race to the Big 12 Championship unfolds.</p>
	
<!--<h3>Round 1</h3>

<p>The opening act of the 2025 playoff spectacle unfolded on December 12, 2025. Last year's champion, Milwaukee Mustangs cruised through the second half of the season and thus claimed the top seed, earning a bye and patiently awaited the outcome of Round 1.</p>
	
<p><b>Gladiators’ Playoff Hopes Crushed by Dominant Wildcats</b></p>
	
<p>The Cleveland Gladiators clawed their way into the playoffs as the 7th seed for the second straight year, narrowly edging out Brooklyn to secure the final coveted spot. But their reward was a daunting showdown with the West Division champions, the Los Angeles Wildcats—a team riding high as on of the league’s top-scoring juggernauts.</p>

<p>The matchup promised fireworks between the league’s two highest-scoring offenses, but only the Wildcats delivered. Cleveland stumbled to a playoff-low 148 points, while Los Angeles put on a clinic, storming to a commanding 226-148 victory. The loss marked the Gladiators’ second defeat to the Wildcats this season and extended their losing streak against Los Angeles to seven games, dating back to 2019, including postseason clashes.</p>

<p>Josh Allen led the charge for the Wildcats with a monstrous 70-point performance, propelling his team to its seventh consecutive win and solidifying their position as the team to beat in the 2025 playoffs.</p>
	
<p><b>Chicago Secures Historic First Playoff Win Over Vegas</b></p>
		
<p>In the second playoff showdown, the #5 seed Vegas Knight Hawks squared off against the #6 seed Chicago Slaughter, who were still chasing their first-ever postseason victory. Chicago entered the season with a bang, setting scoring records en route to a 5-2 start. However, a rough 2-4 finish had them limping toward the postseason. A pivotal Week 14 win over Northern Arizona ultimately punched their ticket, earning them back-to-back playoff appearances.</p>
	
<p>The Knight Hawks, on the other hand, stumbled into the playoffs, losing three of their final four games and becoming arguably the lowest-scoring playoff team in league history. Their offensive struggles carried into the postseason, with QB Tua Tagovailoa managing just 15 points as the Knight Hawks posted a meager 170 in the first round.</p>
	
<p>Chicago capitalized, putting up 208 points and earning their long-awaited first playoff victory after five previous postseason failures. Lamar Jackson starred with a dazzling 68-point performance, while Jerry Jeudy delivered his best game of the season, adding 28 points to seal the win.</p>
	
<p><b>Blizzard Outlast Brawlers in Record-Breaking Shootout</b></p>
	
<p>The weekend’s finale featured the #4 seed Green Bay Blizzard visiting the #3 seed Boston Brawlers in a clash of evenly matched 9-5 teams. It was the closest talent pairing of the first round, and it delivered an unforgettable showdown.</p>
	
<p>For Boston, this season marked a triumphant return to relevance. Making just their second playoff appearance in GM Cholka's tenure—the Brawlers celebrated their best campaign in franchise history, notching a record nine wins and division title. They didn’t hold back, unleashing a monstrous 225 points, breaking Northern Arizona’s playoff scoring record from the prior season. Yet, heartbreak followed as Boston’s historic effort was overshadowed by an even more jaw-dropping performance from Green Bay.</p>
	
<p>The Blizzard exploded for 260 points—a new league playoff record—to claim the victory and advance to the next round. The result marked the end of a storybook season for GM Chris Cholka and the Brawlers.</p>

<p>Boston’s stars showed up, with wide receivers Davante Adams (49 points) and CeeDee Lamb (33 points) leading the charge. Unfortunately, QB Matthew Stafford’s underwhelming performance, producing just half his projected points, left the team short.</p>
	
<p>Green Bay, meanwhile, rode the brilliance of Jared Goff, who shattered the individual playoff scoring record with a staggering 84-point outing. Goff’s heroics, combined with Mike Evans’ 42 points, powered the Blizzard’s high-octane offense. After a disappointing 6-8 season last year, Green Bay is back in championship form, with their sights set on the ultimate prize.</p>	
	
<h3>Round 2</h3>

<p><b>Blizzard Upset Mustangs to Advance to Big 12 Championship</b></p>
	
<p>Round 2 on December 19, 2025, brought a thrilling matchup between the top-seeded Milwaukee Mustangs and the #4 seed Green Bay Blizzard. The game marked the first postseason clash between Milwaukee GM Michael Bautch and his son, Green Bay GM Mason Bautch, adding an extra layer of intrigue to an already intense rivalry. Green Bay, riding a wave of recent dominance over Milwaukee with wins in six of their last eight meetings, continued their strong form. Behind standout performances from Jared Goff (50 points) and De’Von Achane (38 points), the Blizzard jumped out to an early lead on Thursday night. Although the Mustangs narrowed the gap late, Green Bay maintained control and sealed a 207-182 victory. The win secured the Blizzard’s third Big 12 Championship appearance—and second in the past three seasons.</p>
	
<p>For the defending champion Mustangs, the loss was a bitter end to their season. Patrick Mahomes led the charge with 43 points, but his supporting cast failed to deliver, collectively falling 30% short of their projections. The reigning champs, who entered the postseason as favorites, stumbled in their only playoff game, leaving their quest for a repeat unfulfilled.</p>
	
<p><b>Slaughter Surge Past Wildcats to Reach First Big 12 Championship</b></p>
	
<p>The second playoff matchup of the weekend saw the #6 seed Chicago Slaughter travel to Los Angeles to face the 2nd-seeded Wildcats. Fresh off their first-ever playoff victory, Chicago squared off against Los Angeles for the third time this season, having split the regular-season series 1-1. Historically, Los Angeles has dominated this matchup, boasting a lopsided 15-2 record dating back to the Big 12’s inaugural season in 2012. However, Chicago snapped a nine-game losing streak in Week 5, setting the stage for this high-stakes playoff clash.</p>
	
<p>In a shocking turn of events, Chicago dismantled the Wildcats with a resounding 233-133 victory—the second-largest margin in Big 12 playoff history. The Slaughter’s offensive trio of Lamar Jackson, Justin Jefferson, and Keenan Allen accounted for an astounding 119 points, driving the team to its first-ever Big 12 Championship appearance. For Los Angeles, another stellar season ended in heartbreak. Despite securing a league-best 74% regular-season win rate since GM Bautch’s return, the Wildcats have yet to win a Big 12 title, reaching the championship game only once during her second tenure. Notably, in each of the past four seasons, the team that eliminated Los Angeles has gone on to the Big 12 Championship.</p>

<!--<p><b>Blizzard Claim 2025 Big 12 Championship in Epic Showdown</b></p>
	
	<p>New Orleans, Louisiana hosted the 2025 Big 12 Championship which ended on December 30, 2025, featuring the #4 seed Green Bay Blizzard and the #6 seed Chicago Slaughter. Green Bay entered the matchup as slight 6-point favorites, aiming for their second championship under GM Mason Bautch’s leadership, having previously secured the title in 2022. For Chicago, the game capped off a historic season that saw GM Darrien Clay achieve multiple firsts, including the franchise’s inaugural playoff victory and conference championship.</p>
	
	<p>Despite their underdog status, the Slaughter historically thrived against Green Bay, winning four of their previous eight meetings, including three of the last four against Bautch’s Blizzard. True to form, Chicago came out swinging, with Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry combining for a massive 82 points on Wednesday night, setting the tone for what would become the longest matchup in Big 12 history. The Slaughter held the lead through Sunday afternoon, buoyed by consistent scoring from their roster.</p>
	
	<p>Green Bay, however, had their own heroes waiting to rise. Tee Higgins erupted for a season-high 48 points, supported by Mike Evans’ 36, cutting the Slaughter’s lead to 36 points heading into Monday night. With Jared Goff left to play, the Blizzard’s hopes rested squarely on their star quarterback.

	<p>As the dust settles on another thrilling Big 12 season, the time will come to hand out the league’s most coveted honors. From the League Champion to MVP, GM of the Year and division champions every standout performance will get its moment in the spotlight. Check back at season’s end for the full list of winners.</p>
<!--	
<p>The Milwaukee Mustangs continued their stranglehold on the Central Division, claiming their sixth division title, solidifying their status as perennial powerhouses. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Wildcats celebrated their fifth division crown, cementing themselves as a force to beat. Over in the East, the Boston Brawlers claimed the throne for their first division triumph.</p>
	
<p>The spotlight of the 2025 season belonged to seventh overall pick wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase, who earned the coveted Big 12 MVP honor. Chase was nothing short of spectacular, amassing a league-best 409 points. His impact on the Cleveland Gladiators was undeniable, as his stellar play fueled a late-season surge of four consecutive wins, propelling the Gladiators into the final playoff spot.</p>
	
<p>High expectations loomed over the defending champions, the Milwaukee Mustangs, but GM Michael Bautch proved once again he thrives under pressure. Bautch guided the Mustangs to a league-best 10-4 record, securing the top seed in the playoffs. His outstanding leadership earned him the GM of the Year award—his third such honor, breaking a tie with Cory Colvin of Brooklyn for the most in Big 12 history.</p>
	
<p>The Green Bay Blizzard clinched their third conference title along with their second Big 12 Championship, reclaiming their status as a perennial powerhouse. On the other side, the Chicago Slaughter made history by capturing their first-ever conference championship, finally breaking through after years of postseason heartbreak. Their long-awaited trip to the Big 12 Championship marks a turning point for a franchise that had been plagued by playoff struggles.</p>-->
