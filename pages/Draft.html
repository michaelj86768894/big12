		<p>The Big 12 holds its yearly supplemental draft each late June, signaling the start of a new season in the dynasty era. The draft consists of five rounds, with each of the 12 teams receiving one pick per round to select available players not currently on a roster. Draft order is determined by the reverse of the previous season’s standings, giving the lowest-finishing teams the earliest picks. While most rostered players carry over year to year, teams can trade draft picks for future picks or established players, adding an extra layer of long-term strategy to the league.</p>

		<p>Draft Day is where it all begins — and for some, it’s where it all ends. Some owners prepare for weeks, even months; others grab a three-month-old magazine and just pray. Some chase promising youth, while others have even drafted retired has-beens.</p>

		<p>It may not be the day you win the league, but it’s definitely the day you can screw the pooch.</p>

		<p>The Big 12’s Draft Day has become a time-honored tradition over the past decade. Our first draft back in 2012 was an ESPN auto-draft that simply tossed players onto teams. Since then, we’ve turned it into a summer kickoff ritual — a live draft in June that sets the stage for the season.</p>

		<p>It’s all been captured: the good, the bad, and the “who the heck is that?” moments. You can relive every draft right here by tapping one of the buttons below.</p>
