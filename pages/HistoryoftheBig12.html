<h3>Inaugural (2012)</h3>
	
<p>The inception of the Big 12 can be traced back to the spring of 2012 when founder Michael Bautch envisioned a community-driven platform that would bring fantasy football enthusiasts together. Serving as the league's first and only commissioner, Bautch laid the foundation for what would become a thriving fantasy sports community.</p>
	
	<p>The inaugural season of the Big 12 commenced with great anticipation on Wednesday, September 5, 2012. As a testament to its inclusive approach, the league adopted a free-to-play model, welcoming 12 teams into the fold. To foster competition and rivalries, the teams were strategically divided into three divisions: East, Central, and West.</p>
	
	<p>The maiden season culminated in a riveting championship clash, where the Los Angeles Wildcats emerged as the inaugural champions. Their triumph was sealed by overcoming the formidable Tuscon Sugar Skulls in the 2012 championship, etching their names in the early annals of Big 12 history.</p>
	
	<p>This inaugural season not only marked the genesis of on-field battles but also set the tone for the camaraderie and competitive spirit that would define the Big 12 in the years to come.</p>
	
	
<h3>A Period of Evolution and Excellence (2013-2017)</h3>
	
<p>The year 2013 marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Big 12. Responding to the league's growth and to enhance the competitive stakes, the decision was made to introduce team fees. These fees, contributed by each team, were pooled and distributed at the season's culmination, rewarding division champions, the Big 12 Champion, and the runner-up.</p>
	
<p>Alongside this financial shift, changes in leadership brought a fresh wave of energy. Four General Managers - Dave Nguyen, Eryn Turner, Jason Richmond, and Mitch Smith - saw the end of their tenures in 2013. Stepping into these roles were Ashley Coppersmith (Vegas), Bruce Coppersmith (Cleveland), Cody Coppersmith (Miami), and Amanda Strutz (Cedar Rapids).</p>
	
<p>In 2015, the Cedar Rapids Titans welcomed Michael Arroyo as their new General Manager, succeeding Amanda Strutz after her two-season stint. This change marked a strategic move to bring in fresh perspectives and strategies to the team.</p>
	
	
<p>The year 2017 witnessed the retirement of two long-serving General Managers, Ashley Coppersmith of Vegas and Liz Bautch of Los Angeles. The Knight Hawks swiftly appointed Matt Winkels to succeed Ashley, while Los Angeles welcomed Pete Jerving as their new General Manager.</p>
	
	<p>Simultaneously, Tuscon underwent a change as Dan Uribe stepped into the role, succeeding the original General Manager Paris Reed after a few seasons of fluctuating performance.</p>
	
	
<p>Notably, during this five-season span, the Milwaukee and Miami franchises emerged as powerhouses. Under the leadership of General Manager Michael Bautch, Milwaukee secured an impressive record with 4 winning seasons, a division title, 3 conference titles, and 1 championship. Meanwhile, General Manager Cody Coppersmith propelled Miami to 4 winning seasons, 2 division titles, 2 conference titles, and 2 championships, establishing them as formidable contenders in the league's competitive landscape.</p>
	
	

<h3>A Season of Resilience and Transition (2018)</h3>
	
<p>The year 2018 proved to be a defining chapter for the Big 12, marked by unforeseen challenges and notable comebacks.</p>
	
<p>The league encountered an unexpected setback as the General Managers of Brooklyn, Vegas, Northern Arizona, and Boston declared their departure, creating a void that Commissioner Bautch faced difficulty filling. Despite efforts to find replacements, the league ultimately proceeded into the 2018 season with 10 teams, with Brooklyn and Boston opting to sit out the year.</p>
	
<p>In a surprising turn of events, Vegas managed to bring back their original General Manager, Ashley Coppersmith, from retirement to reclaim the helm. Northern Arizona, in search of new leadership, welcomed Dan Shilts as their General Manager.</p>
	
	<p>Despite the altered landscape, the league showcased its resilience during the 2018 season. In a thrilling culmination, Ashley Coppersmith and the Vegas Knight Hawks secured victory in the Big 12 Championship, defeating Michaela Arroyo and the Cedar Rapids Titans. This victory marked a record-tying second league championship for Ashley Coppersmith, underscoring the league's ability to adapt and deliver compelling competition even in the face of challenges.</p>
	

<h3>Challenges &#38; Controversies (2019-2020)</h3>
	
<p>In 2019, the Big 12 experienced a dynamic shift as Brooklyn re-entered the league after a one-year hiatus, bringing General Manager Cory Colvin to the helm. For the first time, the league expanded beyond Wisconsin, introducing non-resident General Managers to restore the roster to 12 teams. Notable additions included Travis Gebel (Boston Brawlers), DeMario Suggs (Los Angeles), and Richard Head (Miami).</p>
	
<p>The 2019 season saw the Inferno emerge victorious, clinching their third Big 12 Championship. However, early weeks were marred by controversy when new General Manager Travis Gebel was dismissed from Boston after just four weeks due to a lineup scandal. Commissioner Bautch assumed control of the team for two weeks until Chris Cholka was brought in as a replacement General Manager for the remainder of the season. To address the incident, all stats and records were reassigned to Chris, effectively removing Travis from the league's history.</p>
	
<p>The year 2020 brought unprecedented challenges for the Big 12 as the global COVID-19 pandemic swept through all aspects of life, including fantasy sports. Concerns arose regarding how the league would handle cases of players and General Managers contracting the virus, coupled with scheduling conflicts.</p>
	
	<p>In a press conference held in late August, Commissioner Bautch delivered a somber announcement: the league would regrettably cancel the 2020 season. This decision, driven by the safety concerns and logistical challenges posed by the pandemic, dealt a significant blow to the Big 12. Rumors circulated about the future of the league, echoing the uncertainties that had surfaced in previous years. The resilience and future of the Big 12 hung in the balance, awaiting the unfolding chapters that would determine its fate.</p>
	
<h3>Resilience, Renewal, and Evolution (2021-2023)</h3>
	
<p>After a one-year hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Big 12 triumphantly returned to action in 2021. Nine out of the 12 General Managers from the 2019 season returned to the fold, with notable departures including defending champion Richard Head (Miami), DeMario Suggs (Los Angeles), and Dan Uribe (Tuscon).</p>
	
<p>Los Angeles welcomed back former General Manager Liz Bautch from a four-year retirement, and Miami introduced a fresh face with the hiring of Adam Levetzow to replace Richard Head. Tuscon saw a changing of the guard as Mason Bautch took the reins, becoming the youngest General Manager in Big 12 history.</p>
	
<p>The league returned to its roots with a free-to-play model, a decision that endured for multiple seasons. A major storyline of the season unfolded in the West division, where all four teams finished at or above .500, making the playoffs—a feat previously achieved by the East division in 2016. General Manager Cory Colvin led Brooklyn to the Big 12 Championship, marking the second title for the organization and tying Vegas for the second most in Big 12 history.</p>
	
<p>In 2022, the league witnessed a rare phenomenon as all owners returned for another exciting season. Multiple tight races for playoff spots and division crowns added to the suspense. In a stunning upset, second-year General Manager Mason Bautch guided the Tuscon Sugar Skulls to their first-ever Big 12 Championship, defeating top-seeded Los Angeles along the way. Bautch, also becoming the youngest to win the Big 12 Championship, led the Sugar Skulls to victory against Dan Shilts and the Northern Arizona Wranglers, both making their Big 12 Championship debuts that season.</p>
	
<p>The 2023 season ushered in significant changes to the league's roster structure, replacing position-specific slots with versatile Player Utility slots. This innovative shift allowed General Managers to deploy players at any position, emphasizing depth over specific needs. Notably, the tight end position saw a transformation, with teams going weeks without utilizing it due to the scarcity of valuable options in the draft.</p>
	
<p>The league also tinkered with scoring, introducing a point system for every first-down. This adjustment led to more high-scoring games, with five teams ranking in the top six in all-time season scoring. The season culminated in the Milwaukee Mustangs securing their second Big 12 Championship by defeating the Northern Arizona Wranglers in a thrilling showdown, showcasing the continued evolution and excitement within the Big 12.</p>
	
<h3>Feelings of Nostalgia (2024-2025)</h3>
	
<p>The 2024 season marked a pivotal year of nostalgia and transformation for the Big 12 Fantasy League. Five teams—Cedar Rapids Titans, Tucson Sugar Skulls, Miami Inferno, Northern Arizona Wranglers, and Cleveland Gladiators—welcomed new General Managers. These familiar faces from the league’s early days brought a renewed sense of continuity while introducing fresh strategies and perspectives to the league’s ever-evolving dynamics.</p>

<p>Following the 2024 season, which saw the Tucson Sugar Skulls claim their second championship in three years, the league entered the 2025 campaign with a sense of finality. This would be the last season under the traditional redraft format before transitioning to a multi-year keeper system with salary caps in 2026. The 2025 season culminated with the [INSERT 2025 CHAMPION HERE] securing the final championship of the redraft era, adding one last chapter to the league’s storied history.</p>
	
	<p>The final redraft season was competitive to the end, as teams fought not only for the championship but also to position themselves for the strategic challenges ahead. In many ways, 2025 served as both a farewell to the league’s roots and a bridge to its future, blending the familiar rivalries of the past with the anticipation of a bold new era of year-round planning, auction strategy, and long-term roster construction.</p>

<h3>The Dynasty Era Begins (2026-Present)</h3>
	
<p>Beginning with the 2026 season, the Big 12 Fantasy League enters its most ambitious chapter yet — a transition to a multi-year keeper format that blends the excitement of an annual auction with the strategic depth of a dynasty league. For the first time, player contracts and salary caps will span multiple seasons, forcing General Managers to think like real NFL executives: balancing star power, cap flexibility, and rookie development.</p>

<p>Draft day will never be the same. Each summer, managers will not only compete for the best incoming talent but also navigate tough decisions on veteran contracts, roster limits, and future planning. Every move — from a blockbuster trade to a late-round flyer — carries lasting implications.</p>
	
	<p>This evolution is designed to amplify rivalries, reward foresight, and create narratives that unfold over years rather than weeks. As the Big 12 enters this bold new era, one thing remains unchanged: the relentless pursuit of glory by the league’s most competitive minds.</p>
