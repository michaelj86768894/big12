	<h1>Who We Are</h1>
	
    <p>The Big 12 Fantasy Football League is a Wisconsin-based fantasy football community founded on April 28, 2012, by Michael Bautch, who continues to serve as Commissioner today. Originally known as the Bragging Rights Football League (BRFL), it began as a casual redraft league among friends and has since evolved into one of the most competitive and engaging leagues in the region.</p>

    <p>Now headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin, the Big 12 features 12 franchises that represent the league’s passion for competition, camaraderie, and long-term strategy. Each season showcases the creativity and football IQ of its General Managers as they navigate the challenges of player management, player salaries, and roster construction.</p>

    <p>Our league’s identity is built on tradition, integrity, and innovation. From spirited draft days to championship glory, every decision matters—and every owner contributes to the shared legacy that defines the Big 12.</p>

    <p>With a proud color scheme of Navy, Bright Blue, Gold, and White, the Big 12 stands as a symbol of excellence and loyalty. The Miami Inferno currently hold the record for the most championships (3), while the reigning champions, the Tucson Sugar Skulls, have claimed the trophy twice.</p>

    <p>More than just a fantasy football league, the Big 12 is a brotherhood of competition and friendship—a place where football strategy meets real-life connections, and every season tells a new story.</p>
